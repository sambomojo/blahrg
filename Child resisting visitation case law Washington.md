> We hold that to find that a parent has acted in bad faith where the child resists court-ordered visitation, the evidence must show that *the parent has either contributed to the child's attitude or failed to make reasonable efforts to require the child to comply.* Here, the record supports a finding that Sara both contributed to Caroline's recalcitrance and failed to make reasonable efforts to require her to visit Christopher

[*MATTER OF MARRIAGE OF LESINSKI AND MIENKO*, 506 P.3d 1277 (Wash. Ct. App. 2022)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=718115926907336364&q=mienko&hl=en&as_sdt=6,48&scilib=1&scioq=in+re+marriage+of+rideout)


> These actions do not constitute "reasonable efforts to require the child to comply with the parenting plan," and are substantial evidence that Mienko's conduct "contribute[d] to the child's attitude" in refusing to return to his mother's care.





If a child resists court-ordered residential time with a parent and "the evidence establishes that a parent either contribute[d] to the child's attitude or fail[ed] to make reasonable efforts to require the child to comply with the parenting plan and a court-ordered residential time, such parent may be deemed to have acted in `bad faith'" under RCW 26.09.160(1). (quoting from Lesinski).
